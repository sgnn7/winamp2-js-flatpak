## Electron'd and Flatpak'd Winamp2-js

**NOTE: If you are running just the Electron app, you _must_ build the `winamp.bundle.js` (`npm run build-library` in the `winamp2-js` checkout folder) on your own and place it in `node_modules/winamp2-js/build/` folder. I did not figure out yet how to get this built with just the installed dependencies.**

PS: This needs a _ton_ of work and is pretty poor quality but it should be enough to get the ball rolling on getting this into a real app.
